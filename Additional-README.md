## **Introduction**

This repository provides a guide for setting up a mobile application development environment in **Flutter**. Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. This README will walk you through the steps to install Flutter, set up your project, and create your first Flutter application.

## **Setting Up the Development Environment**

Follow these steps to set up Flutter and start developing your mobile app:

### **Step 1: Install Flutter SDK**
1. Download the Flutter SDK from the official Flutter website: [Download Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. Extract the `.zip` file to a desired location on your system.
3. Add the `flutter/bin` directory to your system’s PATH variable.

### **Step 2: Install Android Studio**
1. Download and install Android Studio from the official website: [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Launch Android Studio and install the Flutter and Dart plugins:
   - Go to **File > Settings > Plugins > Marketplace** and search for **Flutter** and **Dart** to install them.

### **Step 3: Set Up Android Emulator (Optional)**
1. Open Android Studio and go to **Tools > AVD Manager**.
2. Create a new Virtual Device and select the Android version you want to use.
3. Once the emulator is set up, you can launch it from AVD Manager.

## **Creating Your First Flutter Application**

### **Step 1: Create a New Project**
1. Open Android Studio and click **Start a new Flutter project**.
2. Choose **Flutter Application** and configure your project:
   - **Project Name**: Enter the name of your project.
   - **Flutter SDK Path**: Ensure the Flutter SDK is set correctly.
   - **Project Location**: Choose the directory where your project will be saved.

3. Click **Finish** to create the project.

### **Step 2: Modify the `lib/main.dart` File**
Once your project is created, you can start editing the `main.dart` file:

- **Location**: `lib > main.dart`
- Here’s a simple Dart code example for your `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('My First Flutter App')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Hello, Flutter!')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
